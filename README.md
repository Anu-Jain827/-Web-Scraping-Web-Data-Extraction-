# Project - Web Scraping (Web Data Extraction)
(Guided by Dataquest Course)

### Tools Used-
* **requests library** - This library enables us to download a Web page.
* **beautifulsoup library** - to extract the relevant parts of the Web page.

### Introduction -
* A lot of data aren't accessible through data sets or APIs. They may exist on the Internet as Web pages, though. One way to access the data without waiting for the provider to create an API is to use a technique called Web scraping.


* Web scraping allows us to load a Web page into Python and extract the information we want. We can then work with the data using standard analysis tools like pandas and numpy.


* Before we can do Web scraping, we need to understand the structure of the Web page we're working with, then find a way to extract parts of that structure in a sensible way.
